## Overview

The Action Codes Protocol defines how short-lived, self-contained codes can represent cryptographically verifiable intent for blockchain actions. It provides:

	*	A deterministic code derivation model
	*	A secure, encrypted payload format
	*	A pluggable adapter layer for chain-specific logic
	*	Stateless generation, stateful resolution
	*	Fully off-chain generation and submission flows


#### Code Derivation

Action Codes are derived based on the following parameters:

| Field         | Description   |
| ------------- | ----------------- |
| pubkey          | The user’s wallet public key |
| timestamp        | Millisecond timestamp rounded into 2-minute windows |
| prefix | Optional string for code namespacing [WIP] |
| signature | Signature over a message derived from the above fields |

The derived code is 8-digits long and unique per user, per time slot, and prefix.


#### Validation Rules

To be valid, a code must:

	* Match a hash derived from its inputs (deterministic match)
	*	Be within the ±1 slot grace window (around 2 minutes)
	*	Have a valid signature for the message, verified using the pubkey
	*	Not be expired (default TTL = 2 minutes)

#### Chain Adapter Architecture

Action Codes Protocol defines an abstract adapter interface per chain. 
This allows full cross-chain compatibility in future while reusing core logic.
