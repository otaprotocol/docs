title: 'Security & Determinism'
---

The Action Codes Protocol is designed to offer cryptographic security and strict determinism without requiring persistent on-chain state or user sessions. Every code can be verified, traced, and resolved based entirely on public inputs and signatures.

#### Deterministic Code Generation

<Info>
  **Each Action Code is deterministically derived using the combination of:**
    - Public key (pubkey)
	 - Time window (timestamp, rounded to 2-minute slots)
	 - Namespace prefix (prefix)
	 - Signature over a canonical message
</Info>

This ensures that:
	*	The same inputs will always produce the same code
	*	Multiple clients (relayers, wallets) can reproduce and validate the code without external coordination
	*	No central authority or database is required to issue or verify codes

#### Signature Binding

All codes are signed by the user’s wallet, ensuring:

	*	The user explicitly authorizes the creation of the code
	*	The code cannot be spoofed by any third party
	*	Verification only requires the signature and public key

  Each signature is over a canonical string:

  ```text
  {prefix}:{code}:{timestamp}
  ```

  This binding ensures replay protection and uniqueness within the time window.

#### Encrypted Payloads

Action Code objects are encrypted using the code itself as the symmetric key. This means:

	*	The code is the secret needed to decrypt and access transaction details
	*	Even if a relayer or database is compromised, attackers cannot view transaction intent or metadata without knowing the code
	*	This pattern supports stateless privacy and decentralization

Only the user who created the code (or anyone they share it with) can decrypt and act on it.

#### No On-Chain State or Sessions

	*	No wallet connection is needed to generate or resolve a code
	*	No smart contract is involved in the validation of the code itself
	*	All logic is executed locally or server-side via open protocol rules
	*	Transactions are finalized only after on-chain user signatures

#### Built-in Expiry & Grace Period

Codes include expiration timestamps and are valid only within a short window (e.g. 2–3 minutes):

	* Prevents reuse or replay
	* Encourages real-time interaction
	* Relayers automatically reject expired codes

The protocol also allows ±1 slot tolerance for clock drift.
