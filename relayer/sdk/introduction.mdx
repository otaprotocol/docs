The Action Codes Client SDK allows developers to easily interact with the Action Codes Protocol over official Action Codes Relayer using a high-level TypeScript/JavaScript interface.

It handles:

- Attaching transactions or messages
- Finalizing after user action
- Status polling and observation
- Code registration (with signature)
