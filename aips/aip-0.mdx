description: 'Defines the foundational concept of the Action Codes'

Defines the foundational concept of the Action Codes Protocol: one-time codes that encode an action intent tied to a specific user’s public key.

#### Motivation

Enable secure, one-time programmable actions that can be verified on-chain and used for payment, access, voting, and other workflows.

#### Specification

Each Action Code:

* Is a short-lived, verifiable intent tied to a user’s public key.
* Is delivered via a transaction or payload signed by a trusted protocol authority.
* May include metadata fields like (description, label, memo, and reference, etc.)
* Is resolved through a provided REST API or SDK.
* Is bound to a user’s wallet pubkey at creation or intent level.
* May include a registered prefix, allowing integration with branded or categorized systems. See [Prefix System](/aips/aip-4) for details.
* Codes can be generated directly in wallets, through the open SDK, or via the hosted interface at [Action Codes Generator](https://actioncode.app)
