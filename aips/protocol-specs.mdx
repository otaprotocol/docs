The Action Codes Protocol is defined by a series of open specifications called AIPs (Action Improvement Proposals). These documents outline the expected behavior, formats, and standards across the entire protocol.

Each AIP is versioned, reviewed, and designed to be:
	*	âœ… Interoperable â€“ across wallets, relayers, chains, and clients
	*	ðŸ§© Composable â€“ enabling extensions and new types of code-bound actions
	*	ðŸ›  Implementable â€“ by anyone, using any language or infrastructure
	*	ðŸ”¬ Auditable â€“ fully transparent and deterministic
