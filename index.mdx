## Overview

Action Codes are short-lived, signed, one-time codes that enable secure and walletless interactions in Web3 applications. They can represent payment intents, governance votes, app actions, or any blockchain instruction — all decoupled from the user’s wallet session.

They are built on **Action Codes Protocol**, which powers programmable, shareable, and verifiable code-based blockchain interactions. Our mission is to make interacting with blockchains feel as simple as copying and pasting a code.

## Problem Statement

In traditional web3 applications, every user action requires an active wallet connection and signature. This creates friction, especially in contexts like embedded apps, headless devices, social flows, or mobile-first interfaces where wallet access is intermittent or undesirable. It also limits interoperability between apps and services.

## Our Solution

Action Codes introduces one-time Action Codes - short-lived, verifiable codes generated by a user's wallet and authorized for specific actions. These codes can be consumed by dApps without wallet connection, enabling smooth and secure intent resolution across devices, screens, and protocols.
